## Get started

To install and work on Svelte locally:

git clone https://github.com/ClaraChaouat/Building-a-grocery-app-with-svelte.git

npm install

To watch for changes and continually rebuild the package (this is useful if you're using npm link to test out changes in a project locally):

npm run dev
